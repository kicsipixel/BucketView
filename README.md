## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: OCI Configuration
Ensure you have a valid OCI `config` file located at:


```
~/.oci/config
```


This file must include your API key and profile information. You can generate it using the [OCI CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm).

### Step 2: Launch and Configure
Start the BucketView application and navigate to **Settings...**. Enter your `compartmentId` to fetch the list of available buckets. Select a bucket to begin browsing files.
